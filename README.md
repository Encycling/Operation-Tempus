# UPDATE 9/21/22
So, great news! I fnally found out how to actually fix the bug that ended this project. Bad news, I don't feel like finishing it. This is just a stupid game that chez asked me to code. It's been dead for like 3 months, and I just don't want to finish it because I'm not motivated enough. I commited the final "fixed" build, but it's now an unfinished project.

If you want to know how it broke, basically, I was just being dumb with some if statements. Thats it.

# (ABANDONED AND BROKEN)
I genuinely wanted to finish this project, but there were a lot of java swing bugs that I had no idea how to fix. Worst of all, on stackoverflow, there were no answers that fixed my problem. Thanks to anyone who supported this project. Especially the people in the credits. This project however, allowed me to understand somethings about java, which is a good thing. I was able to actually learn from this project which is important. But, it's in the trash bin :( üóëÔ∏è
